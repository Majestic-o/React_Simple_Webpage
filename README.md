This project demonstrates a dynamic and interactive web page featuring a changing background image and a video with play and pause functionality, all enhanced by smooth animations. Built using key React concepts, this project leverages state management, component lifecycle methods, and conditional rendering to create a seamless user experience. The background dynamically updates based on user interaction or timed events, while the video controls are integrated with animations to provide a polished, responsive interface. This project serves as a comprehensive example of applying React's core principles to achieve a modern and engaging UI.
